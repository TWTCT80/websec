My new portfolio, journal and presentation webpage.


## 🧩 What this is

A simple, modular **one-page portfolio** built in pure HTML, CSS & JS (no frameworks, no nonsense).  
Every project is loaded from a JSON block at the bottom of the file — so adding new stuff doesn’t break the layout or my sanity.

I made this because:
- My GitHub was starting to look like a LAN party gone wrong 💾  
- I wanted a place to show both my **cybersecurity** and **creative** sides  
- Updating a portfolio shouldn’t require a master’s in front-end architecture

## ⚙️ Features

- 🖤 Dark theme (of course)
- 🧱 Auto-generated project cards
- 🔍 Search + tag filters
- 💾 No dependencies, no build tools
- 🧙 Easy to extend with a `projects.json` later

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [x] Base layout & style
- [x] Project filtering system
- [ ] Add live project screenshots
- [ ] Move project data to `projects.json`
- [ ] Maybe add a small terminal-style intro? 😏

## 💬 About me
Former tattoo artist turned cybersecurity student.  
Currently diving deep into networking, scripting, and security — while keeping my love for design and storytelling alive.

If art and hacking had a baby, this page would probably be it.
